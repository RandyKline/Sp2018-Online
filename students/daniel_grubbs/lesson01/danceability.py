Get artists and song names for for tracks with danceability scores over 0.8 and loudness scores below -5.0.
In other words, quiet yet danceable tracks. Also, these tracks should be sorted in descending order by danceability
so that the most danceable tracks are up top. You should be able to work your way there starting with the
comprehension above. And while you could use Pandas features along the way, you donâ€™t need to. To accomplish the
objective you do not need to know anything more about Pandas than what you can infer from the material herein.
Standard library functions that could come in handy include zip() and sorted().
